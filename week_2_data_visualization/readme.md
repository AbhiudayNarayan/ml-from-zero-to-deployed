# Week 2 Project – COVID-19 Data Visualizer

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

This project is part of my 8-week Machine Learning learning journey, focused on building foundational data skills using real-world datasets. In Week 2, I explored Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly for data visualization by analyzing COVID-19 vaccination and case trends in India.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load, clean, and analyze real COVID-19 data using Pandas
- Visualize daily vaccination progress and case/death trends
- Compare total vs fully vaccinated population over time
- Gain hands-on experience with plotting libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

The plot above shows people vaccinated vs fully vaccinated in India over time using Matplotlib.

## 📈 Data Source

**Dataset:** [Our World in Data - COVID-19](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook: `covid_data_visualizer.ipynb`
4. Run all cells to explore trends and plots

## 🔍 Key Insights

- India saw sharp spikes in vaccination rates after key policy rollouts
- There is a consistent lag between people vaccinated (1st dose) and fully vaccinated counts
- Plotting trends helps understand the impact of waves and containment efforts

## 🤖 AI Assistance Disclaimer

This project was built with help from AI tools like ChatGPT to assist with code structuring, syntax corrections, and feature ideas. All code was reviewed, modified, and understood before final implementation.

## 💡 Week 2 Skills Demonstrated

- Data loading & cleaning with Pandas
- Time series manipulation
- Plotting with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- CSV parsing, NaN handling, and trend visualization
- Basic statistical insight extraction

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Extend to other countries for global comparison
- Add interactive filters with Plotly Dash or Streamlit
- Visualize deaths vs recoveries with moving averages
